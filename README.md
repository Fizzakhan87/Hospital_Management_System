This system is all about modernizing a hospital through use of technology. Computers
help in it and take over the manual system for quick and easy functioning. This
hospital management system is quite reliable and is proven in many stages. All the
basic requirements of the hospital are provided to manage it perfectly and a large
amount of data can also be stored. It gives many facilities like searching for the details
